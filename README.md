# Auto-Minesweeper
My first Python project

This is my first ever object oriented project.
I used Python and tkinter.

This is a minesweeper game with the capacity to solve itself where possible.

There are options to highlight and showcase certain process executions, visualizing the solving process.

There are also options to change the solving style.
(Try starting a new game with percent_mined set to 0, then try out all the different
  process directions -- make sure the "to_clear" checkbox is checked in the "Display Processes" Panel)
